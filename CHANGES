  - SVG output: supporting slicing to SVG, using "-o test.svg", very experimental
  - intern: model.scale([x,y,z]) implemented
  - cli: support for `-M scale=s` or `-M scale=x,y,z`
  - intern: fixed vector.py normalize() and __truediv__() supporting STL with bad normals
  - un/retract enabled again

  - cli & extending configs: 
    - cool_fan_speed_{min/max}
    - cool_fan_full_layer=2 (starting fan after e.g. layer 2 is reached), 
    - start_gcode and end_gcode and new config type 'str' as well
    - skirt_lines=3 only considered if skirt_layers != 0
    - gcode_comments = True|False (adding various useful info in Gcode)
    - random_pos = True|False: randomize position of model on the build-plate
  - all the config included in Gcode
  - intern: carrying over 'typ' ('type' in python ;-) of the extrusion in _raw_add_paths, 
            to refine the retract/unretract, this allowed
            have output gcode more descriptive with ';TYPE:..', 
  - cli: support `-l` or `--load=...` to load more configs (e.g. per printer, or material)
  - cli: support `-Q <term>` partial match
  - output filament used at the end of slicing
  + most un/retract disabled for now to confirm extrusion calculation working
  - prints simple models like 10/20mm cube and xyzHollowCalibrationCubeV2
  - finally was able to to run code without build & install, me newbie with python
  - changed various `from ... import ...` to work locally
  - created Makefile to support `make build install`
